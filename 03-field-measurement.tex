\section{Measurement Technique}

The \gmtwo experiment has stringent requirements on the measurement uncertainty of the magnetic field value.  Stringent enough to aim for an entire error budget on the field uncertainty which is systematic.  Each individual measurement needs to be precise enough that the statistical error of the combined field value is negligible.  This puts an uncertainty limit of around \ppb{10}.  The field measurement technique was custom pulsed proton nuclear magnetic resonance (pNMR), a reprise of the measurement technique used in E821.  The probes were designed to have a very high Q-value resonance at the expected resonance frequency of \SI{61.79}{\MHz}.

\subsection{Proton NMR Signal}

The essence of a pNMR measurement is frequency measurement of another type of precession, proton precession.  The source of the pNMR signal is a volume of material with a population of quasi-free protons.  The active volume is polarized in the direction of a large field, in the case of \gmtwo a \bmagic field in the vertical direction.  A secondary field rotating in the orthogonal plane at a frequency approximately equal to the expected precession frequency of B-magic.  The intended effect of the secondary field is intuitively understood in the rotating reference frame.  In the rotating frame the vertically (z-direction) polarized protons experience an orthogonal (y-direction) field which rotates them into the orthogonal plane (x-y plane).  In the lab frame the polarized protons continue to precess at a rate proportional to the strong vertical field.  Precession in the orthogonal plane produces an induction signal in a nearby pickup coil which is subsequently digitized and analyzed.  A result of robust frequency analysis on the pNMR signal serves as high precision field proxy for \gmtwo experiment.

\subsection{Probe Design}
\todo{finish on hw design}
The core design of the pNMR probes was based on the design from the previous experiment. Each probe consists of two pickup coils, a teflon backbone, a tunable capacitor, an alimunimum shell, and a \SI{5}{\meter} BNC cable.  One coil is used to inject the $\pi/2$ pulse which rotates the protons into the orthogonal plane, and the other is the induction coil used to produce the pNMR precession signal.  The capacitor allows the probe resonance to be tuned finely.  The aluminum shell allots some capacitance to the probe and shields against external effects.

The field team at \uw iterated on the probe design making several improvements.  One of the improvements was in the robustness of the connection to the BNC cable.  The new design used a crimp connection to secure the cable to provide a more robust connection.  Another improvement was the design of the tuning capacitor.  With the new design, the tuning of the probe can be done without removing the outer shell.  Removing the shell the has the chance of damaging the innards of the probe, and minimizing removals makes tuning easier, faster and safer overall.  Another major improvement is the material used as protonated, polarized volume.  The new design replaced the water and copper sulfate volume with a petroleum jelly.  The water design was seen to cause corrosion in many of the E821 probes, so the new design should alleviate those concerns and allot the provide a longer, stable lifetime.

The pNMR probes are used in two fairly different systems to measure the field.  The \fps comprises 378 probes located all around the storage ring to achieve thorough field coverage.  The actual volumes occupied by the fixed probes are outside of the muon storage volume.  The purpose of the \fps is to monitor the drift of the field at different locales around the ring.  The other system to use the pNMR probes is the Trolley System. The Trolley contains an array of 17 probes which carve out an azimuthal plane in the muon storage volume.  The trolley runs on rails all around the ring and uses the pNMR probes to measure the magnetic field in the muon storage region.  

\subsection{Fixed Probe System Design}

The pNMR probes signal requires a parallel system of controlled electronics equipment.  The E989 reprised the NMR pulser design from the E821 experiments.  In order to generate a pNMR signal, the first phase is generating a $\pi/2$ pulse to rotate the protonated volume.  The $\pi/2$ pulse is generated by TTL input trigger which is tunable from \SIrange{4}{7}{\micro\second}.  After the the $\pi/2$ pulse, the free induction decay signal is mixed down against a very stable, \SI{61.74}{\MHz} rubidium frequency source.  The resulting signal feeds through a lowpass filter with $f_0$ of around \SI{200}{\kHz} \todo{check value}.  The filtered signal is fed into a waveform digitizer and recorded at a sampling rate of \SI{10}{\MHz} and samplingt depth of $16\;bits$.  The digitized waveform contains frequency information that represents the magnetic field.

\subsection{Absolute Calibration}

The frequencies measured by the pNMR probe system in the ring allows the construction of a 3D map of proton frequencies in the muon storage volume.  The frequency is directly relatable to the field, but not an absolute value.  To get back to an absolute frequency of proton precession in the field and turn that value into the final field value, there must be a correction.  The size of that correction is produced by the absoluate calibration device.  Then, the value is transferred
